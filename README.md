# Byte Force: Precision Perception in Unstructured Terrains

### Offroad Autonomy Segmentation Challenge | GHR 2.0 Hackathon



## # 🚀 Overview

Byte Force provides a robust semantic segmentation solution for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in complex desert environments. By transitioning from a standard baseline to a Transformer-based **SegFormer-B2** architecture, we achieved a significant performance leap, reaching a final **Mean IoU of 0.6788**.



## # 📊 Performance Summary

* **Final Mean IoU:** 0.6788 (Peak at Epoch 21)

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** 0.314

* **Baseline IoU:** ~0.29

* **Improvement:** +130% over benchmark



## # 🏗️ Architectural Evolution

Our project reflects a multi-iterative approach to scene understanding:

* **SegFormer-B2 (Primary Model):** Leveraged for its global receptive field, which is essential for distinguishing broad "Landscape" context from granular "Ground Clutter."

* **DeepLabv3+ (Comparative Model):** Implemented with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale features, specifically helping with depth ambiguity and overlapping features (e.g., Logs behind Bushes).







## # 🛠️ Challenges & Technical Solutions

1. **Severe Class Imbalance ("Sky-Dominance"):** We implemented weighted logic to mathematically penalize minority-class misclassifications, ensuring the model captured critical features like "Logs" and "Rocks."

2. **Domain Shift & Prediction Fragmentation:** To stop "pixel scattering" in noisy desert textures, we utilized heavy hue/saturation randomization during training and morphological smoothing during inference.

3. **Occlusion & Depth Ambiguity:** We utilized the DinoV2 backbone for superior spatial feature extraction, maintaining sharp boundary detection for overlapping off-road features.







## # 📈 Visual Analysis

Our final submission includes a comprehensive performance dashboard:

* **Confusion Matrix:** Validates the model's success in minimizing false positives in the Landscape/DryGrass boundary.

* **Loss Curves:** Demonstrate steady exponential decay, reaching stability at Epoch 18.

## # 🔧 Installation & Usage

To reproduce our results, follow these steps:



### ## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ## 2. Download Weights

  Download the model.safetensors file from the Releases section on the right sidebar of this repository. Place the file directly in the root directory of the project.
  
### ## 3. Run Inference
```bash
  python test_segmentation.py
```
This script will load the weights, process the test dataset, and generate the competition-ready prediction masks along with the performance dashboard.
